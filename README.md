# 💾 macOS Drive Mounter

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A simple, robust, and persistent tool to automatically mount your network drives on macOS and keep them connected.

This script solves the common frustration of macOS dropping connections to network shares after waking from sleep or changing networks. It uses the same reliable mounting engine as Finder's "Go > Connect to Server" feature, ensuring the highest level of compatibility.

## 🚀 Setup Guide

Follow these five steps to get your drives mounting automatically.

### Step 1: Get the Files

Clone or download this repository to a permanent location on your Mac (e.g., in your `~/Documents` or `~/Scripts` folder).

```bash
# Clone the repository using Git
git clone https://github.com/your-username/macOS-Drive-Mounter.git
```

_Or, download the ZIP and extract it._

### Step 2: Configure Your Drives

Before activating the script, tell it which drives to mount.

1.  Open the `drives.txt` file in a text editor.
2.  Replace the generic examples with your own server details using the 4-column format.

```
# --- FORMAT ---
# server_address    "Share Name"    username    "Password"

# --- EXAMPLES (replace these with your actual drives) ---
MyNAS.local             Public          guest       ""
192.168.1.50            "My Documents"  myuser      "SimplePass123"
fileserver.local        "Scans@HP"      scanner     "Scan-Pass!"
10.0.0.10               Backups         admin       "My$uperP@ssw0rd!"
```

**Important:** If your Share Name or Password contains spaces or special characters (like `@`, `!`, `$`, `#`), you **MUST** enclose it in `"double quotes"`.

### Step 3: Open Terminal and Navigate

Open the **Terminal** app and change into the script's directory.

```bash
cd path/to/macOS-Drive-Mounter
```

### Step 4: Make Scripts Executable

Run this command once to give the scripts permission to run.

```bash
chmod +x *.sh
```

### Step 5: Run the Installer

This command will set up the background service and run the script for the first time.

```bash
./install.sh
```

### Step 6: Approve One-Time Security Prompts

The very first time the script runs, macOS will ask for your permission. **This is normal and expected.**

- You may see a prompt asking for permission to control the Finder. **Click Allow.**
- For each new server, you may see a prompt asking, "You are attempting to connect to the server...". **Click Connect.**

Once you have approved these prompts, they will not appear again.

✅ **Setup Complete!** Your drives will now mount automatically at login and reconnect every 30 seconds if they disconnect.

## 🗑️ Uninstallation

If you wish to stop the script and remove it:

1.  **Navigate to the Directory** in Terminal.
2.  **Run the Uninstaller:**
    ```bash
    ./uninstall.sh
    ```
3.  You can now safely delete the `macOS-Drive-Mounter` folder.
